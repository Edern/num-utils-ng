.SH "DESCRIPTION"
By default 
\fBinterval\fR is a program that is part of the numeric utilities package. interval will calculate and display the numeric interval between one number and the next on an input stream.

This can be quite useful for showing quantities of increase or decrease of data when the numbers themselves aren't providing you with what you want. For instance, I wrote this program after wanting to see the rate of change in box office ticket sales for movies on imdb.com. ;-)
